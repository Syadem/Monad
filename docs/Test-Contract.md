# Chippyash Monad

## Monad\Test\Identity

*  You can create an identity statically
*  Creating an identity statically with an identity parameter will return the parameter
*  You can bind a function on an identity
*  Bind can take optional additional parameters
*  You can chain bind methods together
*  Binding on an identity with a closure value will evaluate the value
*  You can flatten an identity value to its base type

## Monad\Test\Monad

*  You can return a value when monad created with simple value
*  You can return a value when monad created with monadic value
*  You can use a closure for value
*  Flatten will return base type
*  You can bind a closure on a monad to create a new monad of the same type
*  Bind can take optional additional parameters
*  Magic invoke proxies to bind method if passed a closure
*  Magic invoke proxies to value method if passed no parameters
*  Calling magic invoke will throw exception if no method is executable
*  You cannot create an abstract monad statically

## Monad\Test\None

*  You can construct a none
*  You can construct a none with a parameter and it will still be none
*  Create will return a none
*  Mapping a none returns a none
*  Calling get on a none throws a runtime exception

## Monad\Test\Some

*  You can construct a some if you have a value for it
*  You cannot construct a some with no value
*  You can get a value from a some

## Monad\Test\Option

*  You cannot construct an option directly
*  Creating with a value returns a some
*  Creating with no value or null returns a none
*  You can replace none test by calling create with additional parameter
