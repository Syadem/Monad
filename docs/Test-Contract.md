# Chippyash Monad

## Monad\Test\Identity

*  You can create an identity statically
*  Creating an identity with an identity parameter will return the parameter
*  Creating an identity with a non identity parameter will return an identity containing the parameter as value
*  You can bind a function on an identity
*  Bind can take optional additional parameters
*  You can chain bind methods together
*  Binding on an identity with a closure value will evaluate the value
*  You can flatten an identity value to its base type

## Monad\Test\Match

*  Construction requires a value to match against
*  You can construct via static on factory method
*  You can match on native php types
*  Matching will return set by callable parameter if matched
*  Matching will return set by non callable parameter if matched
*  Failing to match will return new match object with same value as original
*  You can match on a class name
*  Failing to match on class name will return new match object with same value as original
*  You can chain match tests
*  You can chain match tests and bind a function on successful match
*  Binding a match will return a match
*  You can nest matches

## Monad\Test\Monad

*  You can return a value when monad created with simple value
*  You can return a value when monad created with monadic value
*  You can use a closure for value
*  Flatten will return base type
*  You can bind a closure on a monad to create a new monad of the same type
*  Bind can take optional additional parameters
*  Magic invoke proxies to bind method if passed a closure
*  Magic invoke proxies to value method if passed no parameters
*  Calling magic invoke will throw exception if no method is executable
*  You cannot create an abstract monad statically

## Monad\Test\None

*  You can construct a none
*  You can construct a none with a parameter and it will still be none
*  Create will return a none
*  Binding a none returns a none
*  Calling get on a none throws a runtime exception

## Monad\Test\Some

*  You can construct a some if you have a value for it
*  You cannot construct a some with no value
*  You can get a value from a some
*  Binding on a some may return a some or a none
*  Binding on a some takes a third nonetest value

## Monad\Test\Option

*  You cannot construct an option directly
*  Creating with a value returns a some
*  Creating with no value or null returns a none
*  You can replace none test by calling create with additional parameter
